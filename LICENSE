THIS REACT NATIVE APPLICATION MAY NOT BE MODIFIED NOR REDISTRIBUTED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN MYSELF, ERIC CARTAGENA.

This React Native application is solely up to serve as a reference for those who need
demonstrations how to apply certain difficult concepts - such as swipe gestures or
persistent data storage - for their own personal React Native applications.
I am currently not accepting any git commits for this project.



Thank you,

Eric Cartagena
